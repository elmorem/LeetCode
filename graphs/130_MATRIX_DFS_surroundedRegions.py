'''
You are given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing **letters** `'X'` and `'O'`, **capture regions** that are **surrounded**:

- **Connect**: A cell is connected to adjacent cells horizontally or vertically.
- **Region**: To form a region **connect every** `'O'` cell.
- **Surround**: The region is surrounded with `'X'` cells if you can **connect the region** with `'X'` cells and none of the region cells are on the edge of the `board`.

To capture a **surrounded region**, replace all `'O'`s with `'X'`s **in-place** within the original board. You do not need to return anything.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]

**Output:** [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
